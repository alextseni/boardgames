This is an experimental site used for game development and training purposes.

The first game created for this site using React-Redux is Randix, a variation of the computational game TacTix played in a NxN board.

You can read more about the original game (now in the public domain) [**here.**] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TacTix)
